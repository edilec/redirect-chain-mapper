/**
 * The parse-failure detail must never carry the captured trace back out.
 *
 * Every failure here is captured from a real `JSON.parse`, never hand-written.
 * The defect being pinned is that V8 puts the document ITSELF inside the
 * message, so a synthetic message would not exercise it at all.
 *
 * The first case is the one that fixes the ordering. A document whose own text
 * reads `at position 1` makes V8 write
 * `Unexpected token 'a', "at position 1" is not valid JSON`, so a helper that
 * looks for the offset BEFORE recognising the quoting shape finds that phrase
 * inside the quoted span and slices the document straight back out. Reverting
 * to position-first ordering fails this file.
 *
 * The last two cases pin the other direction. A helper that answered the
 * generic sentence for everything would pass every leak assertion here while
 * destroying every diagnostic, so the position, line and column are asserted to
 * SURVIVE, and the empty-input message is asserted to pass through unchanged.
